This is the final part of the tutorial. At this point, you've successfully drawn a simple rock scene, and a more complex vase and sphere scene, with only using 5 colors! Awesome job! 

This time, you will have to use all of your judgement to decide where to add the colors. Don't worry, this is practice and nothing needs to be perfect, as a matter of fact, drawing hairs and making this image look natural will require you to be loose with your color placement. Experiment with different colors, change from layer-to-layer, adding colors where they are needed and your drawing come to life as you add all 5 values!

For reference see the image above and remember that art is subjective, and practice makes perfect. When finished, save your artwork or hit the 'End' button to return to the regular canvas.
