As we are starting this tutorial with the simple image of a rock, we can easily distinguish the different values of color within the image. Observe the darkest color of the image (black); this will be our color 1. However,we will be using color 2 in this first step. Color in the parts of the image with color 2 that closely correspond. Once finished, the image should resemble the example above.
