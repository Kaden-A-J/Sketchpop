Finally, use color 5 (white) for the rock's highlights. In this image, there's only one small highlighted area. Finally, lower the opacity of the original image to reveal your work. Notice how much detail you can convey with just these five colors. This exercise helps create 'image thumbnails', guiding you to block out colors and shapes without being too detailed. Well done!
