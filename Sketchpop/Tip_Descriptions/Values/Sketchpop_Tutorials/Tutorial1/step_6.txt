Finally, use color 5 (white) for the rock's highlights. In this image, there's only a small highlighted area. Then, lower the opacity of the final image. Notice how much detail you can convey with just these five colors. This exercise helps create image thumbnails, guiding you to block out colors and shapes for more detailed artwork. Well done!
