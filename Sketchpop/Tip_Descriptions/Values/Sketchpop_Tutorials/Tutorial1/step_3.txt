In this particular image, there are only 2 areas with the darkest shadows: the shadow cast by the rock and the curvature around the center of the rock. Apply color 1 to these two areas. Note: Adjust the opacity setting of layer (1) at each step to observe the evolving appearance of the image underneath.
